    <!-- the sequence should be like this:
  [10] initial readyState:loading
  [20] readyState:interactive
  [21] DOMContentLoaded
  [30] iframe onload
  [40] readyState:complete
  [40] img onload
  [40] window onload



  DOMContentLoaded event triggers on document when DOM is ready.
  We can apply JavaScript to elements at this stage.
All scripts are executed except those that are external with async or defer
Images and other resources may still continue loading.

load event on window triggers when the page and all resources are loaded.
We rarely use it, because there’s usually no need to wait for so long.

beforeunload event on window triggers when the user wants to leave the page.
 If it returns a string, the browser shows a question whether the user really wants to leave or not.
unload event on window triggers when the user is finally leaving, in the handler we can only do simple things that do not involve delays or asking a user. Because of that limitation, it’s rarely used.

document.readyState is the current state of the document, changes can be tracked in the readystatechange event:
loading – the document is loading.
interactive – the document is parsed, happens at about the same time as DOMContentLoaded, but before it.
complete – the document and resources are loaded, happens at about the same time as window.onload, but before it.
